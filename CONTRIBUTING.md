## ðŸ§± Component Structure

All new React components must follow this folder structure:

- Components live in `src/component/`
- Each component has its own folder named after the component
- Inside the folder, the main file is named `[ComponentName].tsx`

### âœ… Example

To create a new component `AlertWindow`:

```bash
src/component/AlertWindow/AlertWindow.tsx
```
